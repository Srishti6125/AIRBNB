- Entire apartments have high prices but lower average review engagement.
- Most listings are available year-round, but some high-priced listings are under-utilized.
- Monthly review spikes reveal seasonal trends (e.g., summer travel peaks).
- Mismatched minimum night policies and prices reduce booking chances.

## ✅ Recommendations

- Optimize pricing based on room type and area benchmarks.
- Encourage hosts to increase calendar availability during peak months.
- Flag unrealistic pricing or minimum night values.
- Use seasonal review data to guide promotional strategies.
